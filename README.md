cs-flask
========

This is a very simple "Hello world" flask app in a GitHUB Codespace.

In a terminal run `FLASK_APP=hello flask run`.

Then go to the PORTS tab to connect to port 5000.

In a codespace this had a URL like: https://jkitchin-kitchingroup-codespaces-cs-flask-9jjjv9xhpvg5-5000.githubpreview.dev/. The app just shows "Hello, World!".
